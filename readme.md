History
-------
This piece of work was started by Bart Kiers in 2011 as [a Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6178546/antlr-grammar-for-restructuredtext-rule-priorities) 
and Lex Li picked it up in 2017 to continue the momentum.

Goals
-----
* Compatibility to existing parsers, like Sphinx and [the JavaScript one](https://github.com/seikichi/restructured).
* Linter and Language Server for Sphinx to empower [Visual Studio Code reStructuredText extension](https://github.com/vscode-restructuredtext/vscode-restructuredtext).
* (Probably) DocFX fork to replace Sphinx completely.

Others
------
Issues and questions can be created directly at GitHub.
